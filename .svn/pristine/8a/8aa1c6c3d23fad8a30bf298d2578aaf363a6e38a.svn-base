	abstract = {The development of smart mobility initiatives requires specialized and contextualized policies addressing the needs and interests of many stakeholders involved. Since the development of such policies is challenging, there is a need to learn from the experience of many cities around the world offering efficient and successfully adopted smart mobility services. However, in practice, the information provided about such initiatives is shallow and unstructured. To address this issue, we study the state of the art in mobility services, reviewing scientific publications and 42 smart mobility services delivered by nine smart cities around the world, and we propose a taxonomy for planning and designing smart mobility services. The taxonomy provides a common vocabulary to discuss and share information about such services. It comprises eight dimensions: type of services, maturity level, users, applied technologies, delivery channels, benefits, beneficiaries, and common functionality. The contribution of the proposed taxonomy is to serve as a tool for guiding policy makers by identifying a spectrum of mobility services that can be provided, to whom, what technologies can be used to deliver them, and what is the delivered public value so to justify their implementation. In addition, the taxonomy can also assist researchers in further developing the domain. By identifying common functionality, it could also help Information Technology (IT) teams in building and maintaining smart mobility services. Finally, we further discuss usage scenarios of the taxonomy by policy makers, IT staff and researchers.},

Relying on the basis of {\textquotedblleft}smart transport,{\textquotedblright} Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is evolving as a new theme of research and development from vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs). This paper presents a comprehensive framework of IoV with emphasis on layered architecture, protocol stack, network model, challenges, and future aspects. Specifically, following the background on the evolution of VANETs and motivation on IoV an overview of IoV is presented as the heterogeneous vehicular networks. The IoV includes five types of vehicular communications, namely, vehicle-to-vehicle, vehicle-to-roadside, vehicle-to-infrastructure of cellular networks, vehicle-to-personal devices, and vehicle-to-sensors. A five layered architecture of IoV is proposed considering functionalities and representations of each layer. A protocol stack for the layered architecture is structured considering management, operational, and security planes. A network model of IoV is proposed based on the three network elements, including cloud, connection, and client. The benefits of the design and development of IoV are highlighted by performing a qualitative comparison between IoV and VANETs. Finally, the challenges ahead for realizing IoV are discussed and future aspects of IoV are envisioned.},

	abstract = {More than ever, the automotive industry is shifting towards electric vehicles since environmental and sustainability concerns are becoming important to potential customers. Nowadays, automakers are also integrating connectedness and autonomous components in their produced vehicles to reduce time of travel and increase the safety of the drivers, passengers, vehicles and the whole transportation system. The popularity of Connected and Autonomous Electric Vehicles (CAEVs) led to a growing interest in their development with a careful focus on performance and quality aspects. In modern terms, Quality of Experience (QoE) covers important system, context, and human influencing factors that can drive improvements in the field. A rigorous survey of the literature revealed that QoE influencing factors and performance indicators are neither thoroughly identified, classified, nor modeled in an embracing framework that can be embedded in applications. In addition, QoE investigations are usually focused on specific CAEV subsystems and a broad addressing is practically non-existing. In this paper, the literature is explored for important performance aspects of CAEVs. Recent advances are critically appraised, challenges and gaps are identified, and improvements are carefully proposed. To this end, a thorough taxonomy is developed for QoE in CAEVs with a rich set of quality indicators and a framework that facilitates the integration of QoE concepts in system development. The presented contributions are expected to guide, enable, support, and accelerate future developments in the field.},

Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) is playing an important role in improving road safety, traffic efficiency and infotainment systems. With the growth of the connected vehicle technology, V2X is emerging as a key component in the rapid rise of this technology. Therefore, researchers think that development of robust wireless communication through efficient V2X technologies can significantly improve the vehicular environment. The highly dynamic environment and the mobility factor appear to be challenging for implementation of V2X technology. Similar to other wireless technology, the security issues are also key concerns in V2X. In this survey, we highlight and discuss the main security issues of V2X. Particularly, the main objective of this survey is providing for a comprehensive and structured outline of different research directions and approaches, mostly emphasizing on the security issues and challenges in V2X communication technologies. At first, we discuss the key features of V2X and focus on the standardization techniques used for communication technologies. Then, we introduce the security challenges and requirements of V2X. We also classify present state-of-the-art works dealing with implementing different secured techniques in V2X. We further discuss the project implementation that concentrated on the various applications in V2X. Finally, we identify possible future research directions of V2X, particularly in the area of security.},

	abstract = {Smart mobile applications are software applications that are designed to run on smart phones, tablets, and other mobile electronic devices. In this era of rapid technological advances, these applications have become one of the primary tools we use daily both in our personal and professional lives. The applications play key roles in facilitating many applications that are pivotal in our today's society including communication, education, business, entertainment, medical, finance, travel, utilities, social, and transportation. This paper reviewed the opportunities and challenges of the applications related to transportation. The opportunities revealed include route planning, ridesharing/carpooling, traffic safety, parking information, transportation data collection, fuel emissions and consumption, and travel information. The potential users of these applications in the field of transportation include (1) transportation agencies for travel data collection, travel information, ridesharing/carpooling, and traffic safety, (2) engineering students for field data collection such as travel speed, travel time, and vehicle count, and (3) general traveling public for route planning, ridesharing/carpooling, parking, traffic safety, and travel information. Significant usage of smart mobile applications can be potentially very beneficial, particularly in automobile travel mode to reduce travel time, cost, and vehicle emissions. In the end this would make travel safer and living environments greener and healthier. However, road users' interactions with these applications could manually, visually, and cognitively divert their attention from the primary task of driving or walking. Distracted road users expose themselves and others to unsafe behavior than undistracted. Road safety education and awareness programs are vital to discourage the use of applications that stimulate unsafe driving/walking behaviors. Educating the traveling public about the dangers of unsafe driving/walking behavior could have significant safety benefits to all road users. Future research needs to compare accuracies of the applications and provide guidelines for selecting them for certain transportation related applications.},

Government institutions are implementing roadside infrastructures such as cameras and sensors to collect data about environmental and traffic conditions. By seamlessly integrating vehicles and sensing devices, their sensing and communication capabilities can be leveraged to achieve smart and intelligent transportation systems. We discuss how sensor technology can be integrated with the transportation infrastructure to achieve a sustainable Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and how safety, traffic control and infotainment applications can benefit from multiple sensors deployed in different elements of an ITS.

The V2X systems developed so far have been based on the LTE system. However, the conventional LTE system is not able to support the latency requirements of latency-aware V2X. Fortunately, the state-of-the-art cellular technology standard includes the development of latency reduction schemes, such as shortened transmission time intervals (TTI) and selfcontained subframes. This paper verifies and analyzes the latency of cellular-based V2X with shortened TTI, which is one of the most efficient latency reduction schemes. To verify the feasibility of V2X service, we divide the V2X latency into two types of latency, TTI-independent latency and TTI-proportional latency. Moreover, using system-level simulations considering additional overhead from shortened TTI, we evaluate the latency of cellular-based V2X systems. Based on this feasibility verification, we then propose cellularbased V2X system design principles in terms of shortened TTI with only one OFDM symbol and while sustaining radio resource control connection.},

	abstract = {Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication promises improvements in road safety and efficiency by enabling low-latency and reliable communication services for vehicles. Besides using Mobile Broadband (MBB), there is a need to develop Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) applications with cellular networks especially when safety-related driving applications are concerned. Future cellular networks are expected to support novel latencysensitive use cases. Many applications of V2X communication, like collaborative autonomous driving requires very low latency and high reliability in order to support real-time communication between vehicles and other network elements. In this paper, we classify V2X use-cases and their requirements in order to identify cellular network technologies able to support them. The bottleneck problem of the medium access in 4G Long Term Evolution(LTE) networks is random access procedure. It is evaluated through simulations to further detail the future limitations and requirements. Limitations and improvement possibilities for next generation of cellular networks are finally detailed. Moreover, the results presented in this paper provide the limits of different parameter sets with regard to the requirements of V2X-based applications. In doing this, a starting point to migrate to Narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) or 5G - solutions is given.},

This paper investigates two methods of LTE-based V2X, - Uu-based LTE-V2X which uses infrastructure and PC5-based LTE-V2X which uses D2D communication. We summarize pros and cons of these two methods for CWA, then, show quantitative performance evaluation results in terms of end-to-end latency. The results show that PC5-based LTE has much better performance than Uu-based LTE although PC5-based LTE requires additional functions to the current LTE.},

The topic has drawn interest from a large number of stakeholders, from governmental authorities to automotive manufacturers and mobile network operators. With interest sourced from many disparate parties and a wealth of research on a large number of topics, trying to grasp the bigger picture of V2X development can be a daunting task. In this tutorial survey, to the best of our knowledge, we collate research across a number of topics in V2X, from historical developments to standardization activities and a high-level view of research in a number of important fields. In so doing, we hope to provide a useful reference for the state of V2X research and development for newcomers and veterans alike.},

	abstract = {Due to the growing number of vehicles on the roads worldwide, road traffic accidents are currently recognized as a major public safety problem. In this context, connected vehicles are considered as the key enabling technology to improve road safety and to foster the emergence of next generation cooperative intelligent transport systems (ITS). Through the use of wireless communication technologies, the deployment of ITS will enable vehicles to autonomously communicate with other nearby vehicles and roadside infrastructures and will open the door for a wide range of novel road safety and driver assistive applications. However, connecting wireless-enabled vehicles to external entities can make ITS applications vulnerable to various security threats, thus impacting the safety of drivers. This article reviews the current research challenges and opportunities related to the development of secure and safe ITS applications. It first explores the architecture and main characteristics of ITS systems and surveys the key enabling standards and projects. Then, various ITS security threats are analyzed and classified, along with their corresponding cryptographic countermeasures. Finally, a detailed ITS safety application case study is analyzed and evaluated in light of the European ETSI TC ITS standard. An experimental test-bed is presented, and several elliptic curve digital signature algorithms (ECDSA) are benchmarked for signing and verifying ITS safety messages. To conclude, lessons learned, open research challenges and opportunities are discussed.},

Over the past decade, there has been massive growth in the availability of transportation ICT, in particular, smartphone applications. There is considerable evidence that ICTs have profoundly changed the ways in which transport systems are perceived and used, and mobilities performed, with far-reaching implications for transport mode choices and transport demand. Against this background, the paper seeks to conceptualize ICT with relevance for transport systems, and to discuss the implications for the environmental sustainability of the transport sector. Findings suggest that while some ICT innovations foster and support sustainable transport choices, others raise new and significant barriers to more sustainable transport futures.},

To this end, the communication probability of the beacon transmission is analyzed based on the carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) mechanism. Then, a new car-following model is proposed by considering the communication probability to capture the car-following behavior of connected vehicles (CVs) equipped with V2X communications. The stability of the proposed car-following model is analyzed using the perturbation method. In addition, a nonlinear consensus-based longitudinal control algorithm is designed by considering the interactions between CVs, and an artificial function-based lateral control algorithm is presented. The convergence of the longitudinal and lateral control algorithms is analyzed using the Hurwitz stable theorem and Lyapunov technique, respectively. Also, the string stability of the vehicular platoon is performed based on the infinity-norm method. Finally, field experiments are conducted using four CVs under the scenarios of platoon forming, vehicle merging, and vehicle diverging. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of the trajectory and velocity profiles.},

Meanwhile, another problem relevant to the danger in drowsy driving, involving fatigue level, carbon monoxide concentration, and breath alcohol concentration, was considered and has approximately reasoned to an extra reaction time to modify NHTSA algorithm. A vision-sensing analysis cooperating with global-positioning system is applied for lane marking detection and collision warning, particularly exchanging the dynamic and static information between neighboring cars via inter-vehicle wireless communications. In addition to pre-crash warning, event data recording very useful for accident reconstruction on scene is also established here. In order to speed up data fusion on both quantum-tuned back-propagation neural network (QT-BPNN) and adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), a distributed dual-platform DaVinci+XScale\_NAV270 has been employed. Several tests on system{\textquoteright}s reliability and validity have been done successfully, and the comparison of system effectiveness showed that our proposed approach outperforms two current well-known collision-warning systems (AWS-Mobileye and ACWS-Delphi).},

	abstract = {Dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and 4G-LTE are two widely used candidate schemes for Connected Vehicle (CV) applications. It is thus of great necessity to compare these two most viable communication standards and clarify which one can meet the requirements of most V2X scenarios with respect to road safety, traffic efficiency, and infotainment. To the best of our knowledge, almost all the existing studies on comparing the feasibility of DRSC or LTE in V2X applications use software-based simulations, which may not represent realistic constraints. In this paper, a Connected Vehicle test-bed is established, which integrates the DSRC roadside units, 4G-LTE cellular communication stations, and vehicular on-board terminals. Three Connected Vehicle application scenarios are set as Collision Avoidance, Traffic Text Message Broadcast, and Multimedia File Download, respectively. A software tool is developed to record GPS positions/velocities of the test vehicles and record certain wireless communication performance indicators. The experiments have been carried out under different conditions. According to our results, 4G-LTE is more preferred for the nonsafety applications, such as traffic information transmission, file download, or Internet accessing, which does not necessarily require the high-speed real-time communication, while for the safety applications, such as Collision Avoidance or electronic traffic sign, DSRC outperforms the 4G-LTE.},

	abstract = {Vehicular Ad-Hoc Network (VANET) is seen as an emerging solution to improve road safety, highway assistance and traveler comfort accounting to vivid applications including safety, non-safety and infotainment applications. Over the past few years, research paradigm has shifted towards areas such as multi-hop broadcasting, information security, clustering, etc. covering intra-vehicular and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication modes. Whereas these scenarios provide diversified information dissemination techniques through various applications of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), data dissemination in VANET environment is still a challenging task, mainly due to rapid changes in network topology and frequent disruptions in connectivity. A distinguished area that still lacks significant research contributions is towards designing reliable and efficient Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for vehicular communication in order to enhance travel safety. The main motivation behind such a survey is to integrate a wide range of research contributions that have been recently proposed to envisage the inherent characteristics of vehicular communication. Such a study serves as a reference for an in-depth research towards enhancements in the PHY/MAC layers. In this paper, we present state-of-the-art survey of the MAC protocols available for vehicular safety. We classify these protocols based on different applications and the techniques they adopt. We also review the performance metrics used for evaluating these protocols. In later sections, we qualitatively analyze the protocols based on different parameters along with related issues and the challenges they generate. We highlight the mechanisms involved, conceptual features, optimization techniques, strength and drawbacks of the available protocols as well as their applicability in future deployment.

	abstract = {Transit signal priority (TSP) has been studied as a control strategy that offers preference to transit vehicles at signalized intersections. Although TSP has been deployed in many places, several shortcomings, such as adverse effect on side streets and uncertainty about the benefit, have been identified. Therefore, a new TSP logic proposed to overcome these shortcomings takes advantage of the resources provided by connected vehicle technology, including two-way communications between buses and the traffic signal controller, accurate bus location detection and prediction, and number of passengers. The key feature of the proposed TSP logic is green time reallocation, which moves green time instead of adding extra green time. TSP is also designed to be conditional. That is, delay per person is used as the most important criterion in deciding whether TSP is to be granted. The logic developed in this research was evaluated in two ways: with analytical and microscopic simulation approaches. In each evaluation, the proposed TSP was compared with two scenarios: no TSP and conventional TSP. The analysis used bus delay and per person delay of all travelers as measures of effectiveness. The simulation-based evaluation results showed that the proposed TSP logic reduced bus delay between 9\% and 84\% compared with conventional TSP and between 36\% and 88\% compared with the no-TSP condition. The range of improvement corresponding to four volume-to-capacity ratios was tested. No significant negative effects were caused by the proposed TSP logic.},

Modes 3 and 4 support direct V2V communications but differ on how they allocate the radio resources. Resources are allocated by the cellular network under mode 3. Mode 4 does not require cellular coverage, and vehicles autonomously select their radio resources using a distributed scheduling scheme supported by congestion control mechanisms. Mode 4 is considered the baseline mode and represents an alternative to 802.11p or dedicated shortrange communications (DSRC).

Because of significant recent advances in computation and communication technologies, autonomous cars are becoming a reality. Already autonomous car prototype models have covered millions of miles in test driving. Leading technical companies and car manufacturers have invested a staggering amount of resources in autonomous car technology, as they prepare for autonomous cars' full commercialization in the coming years. However, to achieve this goal, several technical and nontechnical issues remain: software complexity, real-time data analytics, and testing and verification are among the greater technical challenges; and consumer stimulation, insurance management, and ethical/moral concerns rank high among the nontechnical issues. Tackling these challenges requires thoughtful solutions that satisfy consumers, industry, and governmental requirements, regulations, and policies. Thus, here we present a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art results for autonomous car technology. We discuss current issues that hinder autonomous cars' development and deployment on a large scale. We also highlight autonomous car applications that will benefit consumers and many other sectors. Finally, to enable cost-effective, safe, and efficient autonomous cars, we discuss several challenges that must be addressed (and provide helpful suggestions for adoption) by designers, implementers, policymakers, regulatory organizations, and car manufacturers.},

In both cases, evolutions are under discussion. The former is only decentralized and based on a sensing before transmitting access, while the latter is based on orthogonal resources that can be also managed by an infrastructure.

	abstract = {In this paper, a person-delay-based optimization method is proposed for an intelligent TSP logic that enables bus/signal cooperation and coordination among consecutive signals under the Connected Vehicle environment. This TSP logic, called TSPCV-C, provides a method to secure the mobility benefit generated by the intelligent TSP logic along a corridor so that the bus delay saved at an upstream intersection is not wasted at downstream intersections. The problem is formulated as a Binary Mixed Integer Linear Program (BMILP) which is solved by standard branch-and-bound method. Minimizing per person delay has been adopted as the criterion for the model. The TSPCV-C is also designed to be conditional. That is, TSP is granted only when the bus is behind schedule and the grant of TSP causes no extra total person delay. The logic developed in this research is evaluated using both analytical and microscopic traffic simulation approaches. Both analytical tests and simulation evaluations compared four scenarios: without TSP (NTSP), conventional TSP (CTSP), TSP with Connected Vehicle (TSPCV), and Coordinated TSP with Connected Vehicle (TSPCV-C). The measures of effectiveness used include bus delay and total travel time of all travelers. The performance of TSPCV-C is compared against conventional TSP (CTSP) under four congestion levels and five intersection spacing cases. The results show that the TSPCV-C greatly reduces bus delay at signalized intersection for all congestion levels and spacing cases considered. Although the TSPCV is not as efficient as TSPCV-C, it still demonstrates sizable improvement over CTSP. An analysis on the intersection spacing cases reveals that, as long as the intersections are not too closely spaced, TSPCV can produce a delay reduction up to 59\%. Nevertheless, the mechanism of TSPCV-C is recommended for intersections that are spaced less than 0.5 mile away. Simulation based evaluation results show that the TSPCV-C logic reduces the bus delay between 55\% and 75\% compared to the conventional TSP. The range of improvement corresponding to the four different v/c ratios tested, which are 0.5, 0.7, 0.9 and 1.0, respectively. No statistically significant negative effects are observed except when the v/c ratio equals 1.0.},

Autonomous vehicles and connected vehicles are promising technologies to improve road safety and reduce traffic congestion. In this paper we investigate the performance of connected vehicles and assess the positive impact of connected vehicles on the collaborative road safety applications. To achieve the research goal, we first develop a low cost and scalable connected vehicles testbed, which consists of laptops equipped with Wi-Fi transceivers. The main concern is that collaborative road safety applications need to be widely tested with vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications. However, the commercial dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) devices are very expensive, which makes it difficult to set up a large connected vehicles testbed. Based on the experiments on the V2V communications, the performance of forward collision avoidance under emergency events, which is a representative collaborative road safety application, is analysed. Interesting insights to the performance of V2V and the improvement of collision avoidance with V2V are obtained. The research works could be used for the analysis of connected vehicles impact on other collaborative roads safety applications.},

This paper proposes a transit signal priority algorithm using connected vehicle information for multimodal traffic control. The algorithm can also be adapted to scenarios with near-side or far-side bus stops. Moreover, it can minimize either signal delay or schedule delay for buses while minimizing additional car delays. Simulation is conducted for different volume to capacity ratios, bus arrivals, bus occupancies, and penetration rates. Results show that this algorithm successfully reduces the total passenger delay. It is also shown that this algorithm is not sensitive to the assumed bus passenger occupancy, nor the estimation of bus dwell time, hence does not require accurate information on these parameters. Overall, this algorithm seems rather promising as it significantly reduces the delay of buses with minimal increase to the delay of cars in the conflicting approach.},

Once researchers had a thorough understanding of the technology, they focused on selecting and developing the near-term practical applications that use connected vehicle technology. The research team then sought expert opinions from the Texas Transportation Institute working group during two brainstorming sessions, which produced two lists of potential applications and prioritized the applications based on deployment feasibility. In particular, a total of five applications were selected for development of the full concept of operations, including two in safety, two in mobility, and one in environmental security.

	abstract = {This research supports establishing an updated understanding of the pedestrian crash problem and defining a way to connect the crash problem with vehicle-to-pedestrian (V2P) communication crash avoidance technology. It describes 5 priority pre-crash scenarios that might be addressed by V2P communications. Priority scenarios are: 1. Vehicle going straight and pedestrian crossing the road 2. Vehicle going straight and pedestrian in the road 3. Vehicle going straight and the pedestrian adjacent to the road 4. Vehicle turning left and the pedestrian crossing the road 5. Vehicle turning right and the pedestrian crossing the road The focus is on vehicle-pedestrian crashes involving light vehicles (passenger car, van, minivan, sport utility vehicle, or light pickup truck) with a gross vehicle weight rating of 10,000 pounds or less. The 2011-2012 General Estimates System (GES) and Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) crash databases were used to quantify the societal cost and describe the driving environment, driver- and pedestrian- characteristics, and crash contributing factors. These priority scenarios account for 79 percent of all target pedestrian crashes and 91 percent of the fatal target pedestrian crashes. Target pedestrian crashes include a light vehicle striking a pedestrian in the first event of the crash. The highest frequencies of pedestrian crashes (GES) occur in scenarios where the pedestrian is crossing the road. The majority of fatalities (FARS) involved vehicles that were going straight (i.e., not turning or making a maneuver). Kinematic depictions for the time-to-collision and avoidance maneuvers are presented to identify information needs for the crash countermeasures based on V2P technology. This information serves the development of functional requirements, performance specifications, test procedures, and benefits estimation for potential V2P-based safety ups currently researching and prototyping different V2P-based safety systems to help determine which ones are most useful in preventing or mitigating pedestrian-vehicle crashes.},

Automated vehicle (AV) systems have had a longer and more turbulent history, with a recent upsurge of interest sparked by Google's initiative.

	abstract = {Connected Vehicle Technology (CVT) requires wireless data transmission between vehicles (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I). Evaluating the performance of different network options for V2V and V2I communication that ensure optimal utilization of resources is a prerequisite when designing and developing robust wireless networks for CVT applications. Though dedicated short range communication (DSRC) has been considered as the primary communication option for CVT safety applications, the use of other wireless technologies (e.g., Wi-Fi, LTE, WiMAX) allow longer range communications and throughput requirements that could not be supported by DSRC alone. Further, the use of other wireless technology potentially reduces the need for costly DSRC infrastructure. In this research, the authors evaluated the performance of Het-Net consisting of Wi-Fi, DSRC and LTE technologies for V2V and V2I communications. An application layer handoff method was developed to enable Het-Net communication for two CVT applications: traffic data collection, and forward collision warning. The handoff method ensures the optimal utilization of available communication options (i.e., eliminate the need of using multiple communication options at the same time) and corresponding backhaul communication infrastructure depending on the connected vehicle application requirements. Field studies conducted in this research demonstrated that the use of Het-Net broadened the range and coverage of V2V and V2I communications. The use of the application layer handoff technique to maintain seamless connectivity for CVT applications was also successfully demonstrated and can be adopted in future Het-Net supported connected vehicle applications. A long handoff time was observed when the application switches from LTE to Wi-Fi. The delay is largely due to the time required to activate the 802.11 link and the time required for the vehicle to associate with the RSU (i.e., access point). Modifying the application to implement a soft handoff where a new network is seamlessly connected before breaking from the existing network can greatly reduce (or eliminate) the interruption of network service observed by the application. However, the use of a Het-Net did not compromise the performance of the traffic data collection application as this application does not require very low latency, unlike connected vehicle safety applications. Field tests revealed that the handoff between networks in Het-Net required several seconds (i.e., higher than 200ms required for safety applications). Thus, Het-Net could not be used to support safety applications that require communication latency less than 200ms. However, Het-Net could provide additional/supplementary connectivity for safety applications to warn vehicles upstream to take proactive actions to avoid problem locations. To validate and establish the findings from field tests that included a limited number of connected vehicles, ns-3 simulation experiments with a larger number of connected vehicles were conducted involving a DSRC and LTE Het-Net scenario. The latency and packet delivery error trend obtained from ns-3 simulation were found to be similar to the field experiment results.},

	abstract = {Vehicle and pedestrian collisions often result in fatality to the vulnerable road users, indicating a strong need of technologies to protect such vulnerable road users. Wireless communications have potential to support road safety by enabling road users to exchange information. In contrast to vehicle to vehicle (V2V) and vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications for avoidance of inter-vehicle collisions, very limited efforts are made on communication mechanisms for pedestrian safety. This paper addresses the issue in a concrete way. We first formulate the requirement of the minimum information exchange distance for providing road users to have the necessary amount of time to perceive the situation and react. We then report our field tests and measurement based analysis to investigate if a Wi-Fi system can satisfy the application requirement. We also introduce a pedestrian protection application, V2ProVu, which provides the functionalities of the Wi-Fi communications, risk calculation, and hazard alarming. Our study discloses several useful insights including 1) information exchange for a velocity of 80 km/h has to be made before vehicle to pedestrian (V2P) distance is below 72 meters and 2) while this requirement is not too hard for radio communications technologies, the V2P communication range is greatly reduced if the signal is blocked by a human body.},

The technology has a great potential of enabling a variety of novel applications for road safety, passenger infotainment, car manufacturer services, and vehicle traffic optimization. Today, V2X communications is based on one of two main technologies: dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and cellular networks. However, in the near future, it is not expected that a single technology can support such a variety of expected V2X applications for a large number of vehicles. Hence, interworking between DSRC and cellular network technologies for efficient V2X communications is proposed. This paper surveys potential DSRC and cellular interworking solutions for efficient V2X communications. First, we highlight the limitations of each technology in supporting V2X applications. Then, we review potential DSRC-cellular hybrid architectures, together with the main interworking challenges resulting from vehicle mobility, such as vertical handover and network selection issues. In addition, we provide an overview of the global DSRC standards, the existing V2X research and development platforms, and the V2X products already adopted and deployed in vehicles by car manufactures, as an attempt to align academic research with automotive industrial activities. Finally, we suggest some open research issues for future V2X communications based on the interworking of DSRC and cellular network technologies.},

These systems enable people to reach their destinations in a safe, efficient, and comfortable way. In order to reach that goal, several radio access technologies (RAT) such as UMTS, WiFi, WiMAX and 5.9 GHz have been proposed for next generation ITS. Yet, the coexistence of these technologies in the vehicles raises the challenge of choosing the most appropriate RAT. In order to address this problem and define optimal rules for the communication technology selection, comparisons on the network performance have to be done. In this paper, we compare two of the most promising infrastructure-based wireless technologies: mobile WiMAX (based on IEEE 802.16e standard) and the 5.9 GHz technology based on the upcoming IEEE 802.11p standard. We investigate, through simulation, the potential and limitations of both technologies as a communication media for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications.

Among the stakeholders, vehicles, in particular, will benefit from 5G at both the system and application levels. The authors present a tutorial perspective on vehicular communications using the building blocks provided by 5G. First, we identify and describe key requirements of emerging vehicular communications and assess existing standards to determine their limitations. Then we provide a glimpse of the adopted 5G architecture and identify some of its promising salient features for vehicular communications. Finally, key 5G building blocks (i.e., proximity services, mobile edge computing and network slicing) are explored in the context of vehicular communications, and associated design challenges are highlighted.},

	abstract = {Main applications in vehicular networks are primarily looking for road safety improvement. To achieve this goal, positiondata information of all interfering road users must be conveyed effectively. This proposal examines the performance made possible using WAVE/DSRC standard when including pedestrians/two-wheels. First, we propose a specific message format for encapsulating pedestrian and two-wheel position-data information. Second, we propose a complete system for collision avoidance at intersection level. Subsequently, we perform tests to analyze the system performance in terms of packets reception rate and transmission delay using WAVE/DSRC standard in two modes of operation. Namely, we perform a comparison between using only the control channel to announce and forward messages as a safety service, and using one of the dedicated channels 172 or 184 after announcing the service on the control channel. Taking into account different levels of network densities, we investigate the modes of operation that provide lower congestion and channel saturation. The findings in this work are relevant to the design of data transmission patterns for pedestrian collision avoidance systems at intersections when using VANETs.},

An autonomous car can make more convenient, safer, and less energy intensive. In addition, Green Light Optimal Speed Advisory (GLOSA) systems reduce the travel time and CO2 emission. In this paper, we propose a novel GLOSA, called R-GLOSA system to support to autonomous cars. We assume that an autonomous car can access to all traffic light schedules that it will encounter on its route. The route is divided into each segment according to traffic lights. In each segment, an autonomous car can communicate to Road Side Units (RSUs) distributed among the road. An autonomous car collects the road information transmitted by an RSU and then, it optimizes speed in order to arrive at the intersection when the light is green. The R-GLOSA system provides an autonomous car with speed advisory for each RSU's coverage. The simulation results show that an autonomous car using R-GLOSA system outperforms in terms of travel time and waiting time compared to using single-segment and multi-segment GLOSA system.},

	abstract = {The first DARPA experiment with wireless mobile Internet {\textendash} the Packet Radio Network or PRNET {\textendash} was completely independent of the infrastructure. This model was consistent with DARPA military goals as the PRNET was designed to support tactical operations far away from any wired infrastructure. Beside autonomy, the main challenge was mobility and radio portability. Scarcity of spectrum was not an issue, in contrast with the ARPANET quest to utilize those 50kbps Telpak trunks more efficiently. Today, the closest civilian descendents of the PRNET are vehicular networks and smart phone based Personal Area Networks. In either case, the wired infrastructure turns out to play a major role. Moreover, spectrum scarcity has now become the most important challenge (while, ironically, the wired Internet has plenty of bandwidth). In this paper we examine this interplay between wired and wireless and extract a message for the design of a more efficient Future Wireless Internet. We focus on the vehicular network since this field is better established and commercially more viable than that of personal, P2P communications among Smartphones. We are confident however that many of our observations will transfer also to smart phone/infrastructure synergy. Specifically, in this paper we identify the urban Internet infrastructure role in the support of emerging vehicular applications and identify the Core Internet services matching the services in the vehicle grid. As the vehicular applications range from e-mail and voice over IP to emergency operations (natural disaster, terrorist attack, etc.), the type of assistance requested from the infrastructure will vary. A short list includes: (a) addressing (e.g. geo-addressing); (b) directory service, service discovery, mobility management; (c) resource and congestion management; (d) path redundancy; (e) delay tolerant operations; (f) mobile sensor data access and search from the internet, and; (g) anonymity, privacy and incentives. After the review of vehicular applications and properties, we will offer an Internet history perspective to help understand how the mobile wireless network field has evolved from the early ARPANET and PRNET days. This will reveal trends that can help predict the future of the wireless Internet.},

In our system, other vehicles are not simply warned of an approaching emergency vehicle; they also receive detailed route information. Based on this information, timely and appropriate reaction of other drivers is possible. A prototype of our system has been tested in a traffic environment including emergency vehicles and traffic lights. To identify requirements and evaluate our system, we also conducted a detailed analysis of videos from emergency response trips and an expert survey among members of a local emergency response organization.},

Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication technology is used by target vehicles to exchange information, and obtain the driving condition and driving intention of the front driver. To obtain environmental information outside the range of vehicular sensors in advance, in this paper, a vehicle overtaking assistance system is proposed based on V2V communication. The data, including the speed, position, direction angle and steering angle obtained using V2V communication, were preliminarily processed. Then, combined with an overtaking safety distance model, the vehicle parameters, driver{\textquoteright}s driving intention and vehicle status information were entered into an overtaking security assistance system to determine the overtaking conditions. Fuzzy theory was used to control the parameters of the overtaking safety distance model. Finally, the overtaking safety assistance system was established and the proposed algorithm was tested using PreScan/MATLAB cooperative simulation software. The results showed that the proposed overtaking safety algorithm effectively provided a warning according to environmental change and the driver{\textquoteright}s intention, which assisted the driver to overtake and avoid the occurrence of accidents, which improved the safety performance of the vehicle.},

	abstract = {Objective: Intersection movement assist (IMA) has been recognized as one of the prominent countermeasures to reduce angle crashes at intersections, which constitute 22\% of total crashes in the United States. Utilizing vehicle-based sensors, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, IMA offers extended vision to provide early warning for an imminent crash. However, most of IMA-related research implements their methods and strategies only in simulations, test tracks, or driving simulator studies that have quite a few assumptions and limitations and hence the effectiveness evaluations reported may not be transferable or comparable.Methods: This study seeks to develop a generalized evaluation scheme that can be used not only to assess the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety at intersections but to facilitate comparisons across similar studies. The proposed evaluation scheme utilizes the concepts of traffic conflict in terms of time-to-collision (TTC) as a crash surrogate. This approach avoids the issue of having insufficient crash frequency data for system evaluation. To measure the effectiveness of IMA on reducing traffic conflicts, a relative risk is calculated for comparing the risk of with/without using the IMA. As a proof-of-concept study, this study applied the proposed evaluation scheme and reported the effectiveness of IMA on improving traffic safety in a field operation test (FOT). Seven test scenarios were conducted at 4 intersections, and a total of 40 participants were recruited to use the IMA for 6 months.Results: It was estimated that IMA users have 26\% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 5 s and have 15\% fewer conflicts with TTC less than 4 s. However, the results vary across different sites and different definitions of conflicts in terms of TTC.Conclusions: Overall, IMA is promising to effectively reduce angle crashes related to sight obstruction and has potential to reduce not only crash frequency but crash severity.},

The rear-end collision warning system based on DSRC has its unique advantages. However, there are problems (e.g., high rates of false alarms and missing alarms in emergency warnings) in the system due to uncertain measurement errors. In this paper, we propose to address the problems by establishing a robust rear-end collision warning model without using expensive high-end devices. Simulations have shown that high rates (up to 56\%) of missing alarms occur in the vehicle kinematics (VK) model, as well as false alarms (most of which exceed 70\%) in the VK model with maximum compensation (VK-MC). Pertaining to these rates, a novel model based on the neural network (NN) approach is implemented. Through training and validation, the NN model is able to provide emergency warnings with an improved performance of false alarm probability under 20\% and the missing alarm probability under 10\% for all test cases.},

The traffic signal timings and waiting passengers at bus stations can be obtained through the communication between vehicles and infrastructure (V2I). Hybrid vehicle dynamic model and dwell time model are proposed to describe trajectories of the bus transit and delay caused by passengers get on and off at each station, respectively. Considering the numbers of passengers at each platform are uncertainty, introducing model predictive control which can updates the current numbers of passengers through V2I at the platform. The global optimal control model is solved with the model predictive control and sub-optimal branch and bound algorithm. An approximately eight-kilometer traffic network including six intersections and seven bus stations of Beijing Bus Line 52 in Chaoyang District, Beijing, is chosen to investigate the performance of the developed eco-driving approach.},

	abstract = {Both coordinated-actuated signal control systems and signal priority control systems have been widely deployed for the last few decades. However, these two control systems are often conflicting with each due to different control objectives. This paper aims to address the conflicting issues between actuated-coordination and multi-modal priority control. Enabled by vehicle-to-infrastructure (v2i) communication in Connected Vehicle Systems, priority eligible vehicles, such as emergency vehicles, transit buses, commercial trucks, and pedestrians are able to send request for priority messages to a traffic signal controller when approaching a signalized intersection. It is likely that multiple vehicles and pedestrians will send requests such that there may be multiple active requests at the same time. A request-based mixed-integer linear program (MILP) is formulated that explicitly accommodate multiple priority requests from different modes of vehicles and pedestrians while simultaneously considering coordination and vehicle actuation. Signal coordination is achieved by integrating virtual coordination requests for priority in the formulation. A penalty is added to the objective function when the signal coordination is not fulfilled. This {\textquotedblleft}soft{\textquotedblright} signal coordination allows the signal plan to adjust itself to serve multiple priority requests that may be from different modes. The priority-optimal signal timing is responsive to real-time actuations of non-priority demand by allowing phases to extend and gap out using traditional vehicle actuation logic. The proposed control method is compared with state-of-practice transit signal priority (TSP) both under the optimized signal timing plans using microscopic traffic simulation. The simulation experiments show that the proposed control model is able to reduce average bus delay, average pedestrian delay, and average passenger car delay, especially for highly congested condition with a high frequency of transit vehicle priority requests.},

Reducing the space needed to park cars has led to the development of fully automated and mechanical parking systems. These systems are, however, limitedly deployed because of their construction and maintenance costs. Leveraging on semi and fully-autonomous vehicular technology, as well as on the electric propulsion paradigm and in vehicular ad hoc networking, we propose a new parking concept where the mobility of parked vehicles is managed by a parking lot controller to create space for cars entering or exiting the parking lot, in a collaborative manner. We show that the space needed to park such vehicles can be reduced to half the space needed with conventional parking lot designs. We also show that the total travelled distance of vehicles in this new parking lot paradigm can be 30\% less than in conventional parking lots. Our proposal can have important consequences in parking costs and in urban landscape.},

This situation stresses the need for an intelligent transport system (ITS) that improves road safety and security by avoiding human errors with the use of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Therefore, this survey discusses the current development of two main components of an ITS: (1) gathering of AVs surrounding data using sensors; and (2) enabling vehicular communication technologies. First, the paper discusses various sensors and their role in AVs. Then, various communication technologies for AVs to facilitate vehicle to everything (V2X) communication are discussed. Based on the transmission range, these technologies are grouped into three main categories: long-range, medium-range and short-range. The short-range group presents the development of Bluetooth, ZigBee and ultra-wide band communication for AVs. The medium-range examines the properties of dedicated short-range communications (DSRC). Finally, the long-range group presents the cellular-vehicle to everything (C-V2X) and 5G-new radio (5G-NR). An important characteristic which differentiates each category and its suitable application is latency. This research presents a comprehensive study of AV technologies and identifies the main advantages, disadvantages, and challenges.},

The current demand for machine-type communications (MTC) has resulted in a variety of communication technologies with diverse service requirements to achieve the modern IoT vision. More recent cellular standards like long-term evolution (LTE) have been introduced for mobile devices but are not well suited for low-power and low data rate devices such as the IoT devices. To address this, there is a number of emerging IoT standards. Fifth generation (5G) mobile network, in particular, aims to address the limitations of previous cellular standards and be a potential key enabler for future IoT. In this paper, the state-of-the-art of the IoT application requirements along with their associated communication technologies are surveyed. In addition, the third generation partnership project cellular-based low-power wide area solutions to support and enable the new service requirements for Massive to Critical IoT use cases are discussed in detail, including extended coverage global system for mobile communications for the Internet of Things, enhanced machine-type communications, and narrowband-Internet of Things. Furthermore, 5G new radio enhancements for new service requirements and enabling technologies for the IoT are introduced. This paper presents a comprehensive review related to emerging and enabling technologies with main focus on 5G mobile networks that is envisaged to support the exponential traffic growth for enabling the IoT. The challenges and open research directions pertinent to the deployment of massive to critical IoT applications are also presented in coming up with an efficient context-aware congestion control mechanism.},

The important innovations in wireless and digital electronics will support many applications in the areas of safety, environmental and emissions control, driving assistance, diagnostics and maintenance in the transport domain. It is evident that wireless communication technologies can be used in-vehicle, inter-vehicle and between vehicle and infrastructure in transport applications. Among the different possibilities, Bluetooth is currently the most widely used automotive wireless technology for in-vehicle communication while Wi-Fi is used for vehicle to vehicle communication by several pilot research projects. ZigBee also has a role, mainly in the interconnection of wireless sensor with vehicles and infrastructure. The Embedded Middleware in Mobility Applications project (EMMA) is funded under the Information Society Technologies (IST) Priority of the 6th Framework Programme of the European Commission. Intelligent Transport System applications will be taken as a pilot example where EMMA will foster cost-efficient ambient intelligence systems with optimal performance, high confidence and faster deployment. It is necessary to find suitable communication technologies to integrate heterogeneous devices such as sensors inside the vehicle level up to motes belonging to the infrastructure. The paper will focus on our experience of using ZigBee protocol for the infrastructure and vehicle sensor network in the EMMA project. Mainly, how communication between the vehicle (highly mobile) and the infrastructure can be handled using ZigBee as the most suitable communication technology in the EMMA project validation applications.},

Long-range technologies are used to form Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN). Many LPWAN technologies are available, and they offer different performances, business models etc., answering different applications\&rsquo; needs. This makes it hard to find the right tool for a specific use case.

More precisely, we conduct in-depth study of the current security issues, solutions, and standards used in vehicular networks and then we identify the security gaps in the existing VANET security solutions. We investigate the security features of 5G networks and discuss how they can be leveraged in vehicular networks to enable a seamless and efficient integration.

Long Range (LoRa), as a representative LPWA technology, has the potential to satisfy the growing demand for the longer range and larger amount connectivities in vehicular communication networks. In this paper, LoRa is firstly applied into two typical vehicular networks, namely Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I)and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), and performance of LoRa schemes with different parameter configurations are evaluated and compared. Further, Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the schemes equipped with higher bandwidth or lower spreading factor exhibit significant advantages in combating the fast fading caused by Doppler effect in networks.},

The paper introduces the instrumentation for the analysis of end-to-end latency seen by the end-user application. For two specific network scenarios performance evaluations with regard to latency using different parametrization of spreading factor and payload size are carried out. The analysis shows that LoRaWAN may be applicable for selected Industrial IoT use cases where lower Spreading Factors (SF) are adequate, resulting in an achievable end-to-end delay of below 400 ms. For long distance transmission up to 15km requiring a high SF, the end-to-end latency is well above one second and far beyond real-time availability of sensor data.},

It supports the realization of a large variety of Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) applications and services by enabling real-time data exchanges between vehicles, between vehicles and infrastructure systems. C-ITS technologies extend the driver perception to the traffic ahead, avoid potential road hazard situations, collision risks and improve traffic efficiency. Automobile and road operator stakeholders in Europe and in North America have been jointly driving research and development of the C-ITS for more than a decade. Message sets specifications, standardization, and validation consist of one key activity for VANET technology development in world wide. Even though some differences are observed in technical features of message sets in order to satisfy regional specific requirements, commonality is often found in terms of basic features and application usages. Recently, some regions in the EU and in North America have realized large-scale field tests and entered the phase of C-ITS pilot deployment. The present chapter provides an overview of the C-ITS core message sets being standardized and planned to be deployed in the EU and in North America.},

Currently there are two main vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies, whose primary application is focused on ITS, backed up by the key players of various automotive, telecommunication and transport industries: dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X), respectively based on IEEE 802.11p and 3GPP LTE/5G NR. While DSRC already has deployments, C-V2X is expected to see larger scale trails and deployments in 2020. In this work, the authors provide insight and review into two main V2X technologies, DSRC and C-V2X, their core parameters, shortcomings and limitations, and explore the need for integration of IoT-based technologies into modern ITS solutions. A comprehensive overview and analysis of currently commercially available V2X products, their sub-blocks and features is provided.},

	abstract = {In a fully autonomous car - steering, deceleration and acceleration are completely controlled by the intelligence built into it. This leads to a major change in user experience as the driver needs different information and is less involved in the driving itself. We are working on redesigning the user experience of the autonomous car from a holistic user experience perspective of the driver. Our design was driven by a more anthropomorphic view of the car. The driving metaphor being that an autonomous car and the driver are travelling companions. Our work currently is geared towards emulating the key characteristics of this friendship and formulating a design scheme to design each device (and modality within). In this paper we introduce this idea and exemplify some design decisions by referring to a new dashboard for the autonomous car simulator at Stanford. This paper will underline our position that we strongly believe user experience design for autonomous cars needs a tremendous shift towards a more elaborated understanding of user interactions as well as new approaches in order to address the challenges given by the changed experience of the autonomous driving.},

Even though driving itself has remained relatively unchanged, there are now a wide variety of new in-car tasks, which people perform with both integrated infotainment systems and their mobile devices. To gain insights into this new task context and how it could be improved, we conducted a qualitative, contextual study in which we observed real-life car journeys with eight participants. The focus was on user interaction with touchscreen mobile devices, due to their wide range of functions and services. The findings show that the car is an extension of other contexts and it contains a rich set of infotainment tasks, including use of social media. Drivers emphasized gesture interaction and the use of non-visual modalities, for replacing visual information and notifying of changes in the driving context. Based on the findings, we present design implications for future in-car infotainment systems.},

A taxonomy (or taxinomical classification) is a scheme of classification, especially a hierarchical classification, in which things are organized into groups or types. Among other things, a taxonomy can be used to organize and index knowledge (stored as documents, articles, videos, etc.), such as in the form of a library classification system, or a search engine taxonomy, so that users can more easily find the information they are searching for. Many taxonomies are hierarchies (and thus, have an intrinsic tree structure), but not all are.
Originally, taxonomy referred only to the categorisation of organisms or a particular categorisation of organisms. In a wider, more general sense, it may refer to a categorisation of things or concepts, as well as to the principles underlying such a categorisation. Taxonomy organizes taxonomic units known as "taxa" (singular "taxon").
Taxonomy is different from meronomy, which deals with the categorisation of parts of a whole.},
