	abstract = {Low power wide area networks (LPWAN) are widely used in IoT applications as they offer low power consumption and long-range communication. LoRaWAN and SigFox have taken the top positions in the unlicensed ISM bands, while LTE-M and NB-IoT have emerged within cellular networks. We focus on unlicensed bands operation because of their availability for both private and public use with one{\textquoteright}s own infrastructure. New technologies have since been developed to overcome limitations of LoRaWAN and SigFox, based on LoRa or other modulation techniques, and are finding their way mainly into the industrial IoT. These include Symphony Link or Ingenu RPMA. To the best of our knowledge, previous works have not been focused on comparing LPWAN technologies in-depth including alternatives to the link and network layers over LoRa other than LoRaWAN. This paper provides a detailed comparative study of these technologies and potential application scenarios. We defend that LoRaWAN is the most suitable for small-scale or public deployments, while Symphony Link provides a robust solution for industrial environments. SigFox is one the most widely deployed networks; and RPMA has the advantage of using the 2.4GHz band, equally regulated in most countries.},

	abstract = {Low-power wide area (LPWA) technologies are strongly recommended as the underlying networks for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. They offer attractive features, including wide-range coverage, long battery life, and low data rates. This paper reviews the current trends in this technology, with an emphasis on the services it provides and the challenges it faces. The industrial paradigms for LPWA implementation are presented. Compared with other work in the field, this paper focuses on the need for integration among different LPWA technologies and recommends the appropriate LPWA solutions for a wide range of IoT application and service use cases. Opportunities created by these technologies in the market are also analyzed. The latest research efforts to investigate and improve the operation of LPWA networks are also compared and classified to enable researchers to quickly get up to speed on the current status of this technology. Finally, challenges facing LPWA are identified and directions for future research are recommended.},
